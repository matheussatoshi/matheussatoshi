# üëã Hi there

I'm Matheus dos Santos Figueiredo, a developer passionate about technology and driven by challenges.  
I've been in the field for 4 years and have had the opportunity to work on diverse projects that broadened my perspective on building software with purpose.

# üöÄ Expertise

I've worked both as a developer and a systems analyst, and I've also contributed by leading key technical decisions in high-impact products. I communicate ideas clearly, document decisions effectively, and guide processes with objectivity and precision.

Outside of the day-to-day work, I'm also a tech content creator. My style is straightforward and approachable, blending humor with deep technical insights to make learning enjoyable and effective.

I'm especially interested in topics like Rust, backend integration, performance optimization, and building well-structured, scalable design systems.
